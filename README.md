Arduino Thermometer
===================

A simple setup that reads the temperature from an IC and displays it using 8 leds. Each led has an associated temperature. The lowest one indicates that the temperature is under 17 degrees, the highest one that the temperature is higher than 23 degrees. The unit used for temperature is degrees centigrade.
